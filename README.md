3. **sendMessage**: Send paid messages to KOLs
4. **answerMessage**: KOLs reply to messages
5. **processRefund**: Process refunds for expired unreplied messages
6. **withdrawKOLBalance**: KOLs withdraw available balance

- Message sending and receiving
- Message reply mechanism
- Refund processing
- Balance withdrawal functionality

## Deployment Guide

### Testnet Deployment

1. Configure your deployment environment variables (create a `.env` file):
```
PRIVATE_KEY=your_wallet_private_key
BSC_TESTNET_URL=https://data-seed-prebsc-1-s1.binance.org:8545/
```

2. Deploy to BSC testnet:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network bscTestnet
```

### Mainnet Deployment

1. Ensure your environment variables include mainnet information:
```
PRIVATE_KEY=your_wallet_private_key
BSC_MAINNET_URL=https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/
```

2. Deploy to BSC mainnet:
```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network bscMainnet
```

## Security Considerations

The contract implements various security mechanisms:
- Uses OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard to prevent reentrancy attacks
- Follows the checks-effects-interactions pattern
- Limits message length to prevent DOS attacks
- Contract ownership control implemented through Ownable

## Fee Model

- Platform charges a 5% service fee (based on 1000, set to 50)
- KOLs not replying to messages in time results in a 50% refund to users
- KOLs receive the remaining income (minus platform fees and possible refunds)
